= Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with Spring

* -- complements -- Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
  ** Reason: üß† ANOTHER way of thinking about program structure üß†
    *** unit of modularity | OOP = class,
    *** unit of modularity | AOP = aspect
* Aspects
  ** enable "crosscutting" concerns
    *** := modularization of concerns (_Example:_ transaction management) / cut across multiple types and objects
* Spring AOP framework
  ** complements Spring IoC / -- provide a -- very capable middleware solution
    *** üëÅÔ∏è (in the other way around) Spring IoC -- does NOT depend on -- AOP üëÅÔ∏è
  ** uses
    *** provide declarative enterprise services -- _Example:_ xref:data-access/transaction/declarative.adoc[declarative transaction management] --
      **** üëÅÔ∏è if you are interested ONLY in generic declarative services or other pre-packaged declarative middleware services (_Example:_ pooling) -> NOT need to work with Spring AOP üëÅÔ∏è
    *** implement custom aspects / -- complement -- OOP
* goal
  ** writing custom aspects | Spring /
    *** fully typed advice + use of AspectJ pointcut language
    *** still using Spring AOP
    *** ways
