= Lazy-initialized Beans

* `ApplicationContext` implementations, initialization process behavior
    ** [Default] eagerly (== at startup) create & configure ALL xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singleton] beans
        *** Reasons: 🧠 errors in the configuration OR surrounding environment are discovered immediately 🧠
    ** `@Lazy @Bean` or `<bean lazy-initi>` prevents pre-instantiation of 👁️1! singleton bean 👁️
        *** == as soon as the bean is requirested -> IoC container creates a bean instance
        *** if a lazy-initialized bean is a dependency of a singleton bean / not lazy-initialized -> `ApplicationContext` creates the lazy-initialized bean at startup
            **** Reason: 🧠 singleton's dependencies must be satisfied 🧠
        *** _Example:_

    include-code::./ApplicationConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

    ** `@Lazy @Configuration` or `<bean default-lazy-initi>` prevents pre-instantiation of 👁️set singleton bean 👁️
        *** _Example:_
