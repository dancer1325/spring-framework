= Interception / HandlerInterceptor

* uses
    ** | `HandlerMapping` implementations
        *** -> allows applying functionality across requests
* can implement the methods
    ** `preHandle(..)`
        *** == callback /
            **** before the actual handler is run
            **** returns a boolean
                ***** if the method returns `true` -> execution continues
                ***** if it returns `false` ->  rest of the execution chain is bypassed & the handler is NOT called
    ** `postHandle(..)`
        *** == callback /
            **** after the handler is run
    ** `afterCompletion(..)`
        *** == callback /
            **** after the COMPLETE request has finished
* for `@ResponseBody` and `ResponseEntity` controller methods -> response is written and committed | `HandlerAdapter` & before `postHandle` is called
    ** -> TOO late to change the response -- _Example:_ add an extra header --
        *** Solution1: implement `ResponseBodyAdvice` + declare it as xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.adoc[Controller Advice] bean
        *** Solution2: configure directly on `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter`
* how to configure
    ** via xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/interceptors.adoc[Interceptors]
    ** register them directly -- via -- setters on individual `HandlerMapping` implementations
* recommendations
    ** NOT suited as a security layer
        *** Reason: ðŸ§  potential mismatch with -- annotated controller path matching ðŸ§ 
        *** use Spring Security OR approach / -- integrated with -- the Servlet filter chain
