= Reactive Libraries

* `spring-webflux`
  ** -- depends on -- `reactor-core` / 
    *** uses
      **** internally to
        ***** compose asynchronous logic
        ***** provide Reactive Streams support
* WebFlux APIs
  ** return 
    *** `Flux` or
    *** `Mono`
      **** used internally
  ** leniently accept as input
    *** ANY Reactive Streams `Publisher` implementation
      **** if `Publisher` is provided -> it -- can be treated ONLY as a -- stream / unknown semantics (0..N)
    ** if semantics are known -> wrap it with `Flux` or `Mono.from(Publisher)` 
      *** ⚠️ instead of passing the raw `Publisher` ⚠️
      *** helps to express cardinality
        **** _Example:_ 1 or >1 asynchronous values are expected / -- can be essential for -- making decisions (for example, when encoding or decoding HTTP messages)
* WebFlux
  ** | annotated controllers
    *** -- transparently adapts, thanks to {spring-framework-api}/core/ReactiveAdapterRegistry.html[`ReactiveAdapterRegistry`], to the -- reactive library / chosen by the application
      **** {spring-framework-api}/core/ReactiveAdapterRegistry.html[`ReactiveAdapterRegistry`]
        ***** built-in support for
          ****** RxJava 3
          ****** Kotlin coroutines
          ****** SmallRye Mutiny
        ***** -- provides -- pluggable support for
          ****** reactive library
          ****** other asynchronous types
