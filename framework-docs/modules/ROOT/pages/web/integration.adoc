== Common Configuration

* common Spring configuration
	** layered architecture / web layer
		*** one of many layers
		*** == entry points | server-side application / -- delegates, to satisfy business-specific, to -- service objects (facades) /
			**** defined | service layer
			**** presentation-technology agnostic
			**** vs other business-specific objects, data-access objects -- exist -- | distinct "business context"
* goal
	** configure a Spring container (`WebApplicationContext`) / contains ALL of the 'business beans' | your application
		*** == üëÅÔ∏è | your web application¬¥s standard Jakarta EE servlet `web.xml` üëÅÔ∏è
			**** declare {spring-framework-api}/web/context/ContextLoaderListener.html[`ContextLoaderListener`] 
			**** add a `contextConfigLocation` `<context-param/>` / -- defines -- set of Spring XML configuration files to load

// TODO:
Consider the following `<listener/>` configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
----

Further consider the following `<context-param/>` configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<context-param>
		<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>/WEB-INF/applicationContext*.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>
----

If you do not specify the `contextConfigLocation` context parameter, the
`ContextLoaderListener` looks for a file called `/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` to
load. Once the context files are loaded, Spring creates a
{spring-framework-api}/web/context/WebApplicationContext.html[`WebApplicationContext`]
object based on the bean definitions and stores it in the `ServletContext` of the web
application.

All Java web frameworks are built on top of the Servlet API, so you can use the
following code snippet to get access to this "business context" `ApplicationContext`
created by the `ContextLoaderListener`.

The following example shows how to get the `WebApplicationContext`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	WebApplicationContext ctx = WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(servletContext);
----

The
{spring-framework-api}/web/context/support/WebApplicationContextUtils.html[`WebApplicationContextUtils`]
class is for convenience, so you need not remember the name of the `ServletContext`
attribute. Its `getWebApplicationContext()` method returns `null` if an object
does not exist under the `WebApplicationContext.ROOT_WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE`
key. Rather than risk getting `NullPointerExceptions` in your application, it is better
to use the `getRequiredWebApplicationContext()` method. This method throws an exception
when the `ApplicationContext` is missing.

Once you have a reference to the `WebApplicationContext`, you can retrieve beans by their
name or type. Most developers retrieve beans by name and then cast them to one of their
implemented interfaces.

Fortunately, most of the frameworks in this section have simpler ways of looking up beans.
Not only do they make it easy to get beans from a Spring container, but they also let you
use dependency injection on their controllers. Each web framework section has more detail
on its specific integration strategies.




[[jsf]]
== JSF

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the JCP's standard component-based, event-driven web
user interface framework. It is an official part of the Jakarta EE umbrella but also
individually usable, e.g. through embedding Mojarra or MyFaces within Tomcat.

Please note that recent versions of JSF became closely tied to CDI infrastructure
in application servers, with some new JSF functionality only working in such an
environment. Spring's JSF support is not actively evolved anymore and primarily
exists for migration purposes when modernizing older JSF-based applications.

The key element in Spring's JSF integration is the JSF `ELResolver` mechanism.



[[jsf-springbeanfaceselresolver]]
=== Spring Bean Resolver

`SpringBeanFacesELResolver` is a JSF compliant `ELResolver` implementation,
integrating with the standard Unified EL as used by JSF and JSP. It delegates to
Spring's "business context" `WebApplicationContext` first and then to the
default resolver of the underlying JSF implementation.

Configuration-wise, you can define `SpringBeanFacesELResolver` in your JSF
`faces-context.xml` file, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<faces-config>
		<application>
			<el-resolver>org.springframework.web.jsf.el.SpringBeanFacesELResolver</el-resolver>
			...
		</application>
	</faces-config>
----



[[jsf-facescontextutils]]
=== Using `FacesContextUtils`

A custom `ELResolver` works well when mapping your properties to beans in
`faces-config.xml`, but, at times, you may need to explicitly grab a bean.
The {spring-framework-api}/web/jsf/FacesContextUtils.html[`FacesContextUtils`]
class makes this easy. It is similar to `WebApplicationContextUtils`, except that
it takes a `FacesContext` parameter rather than a `ServletContext` parameter.

The following example shows how to use `FacesContextUtils`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ApplicationContext ctx = FacesContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(FacesContext.getCurrentInstance());
----




[[struts]]
== Apache Struts

Invented by Craig McClanahan, https://struts.apache.org[Struts] is an open-source project
hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. Struts 1.x greatly simplified the
JSP/Servlet programming paradigm and won over many developers who were using proprietary
frameworks. It simplified the programming model; it was open source; and it had a large
community, which let the project grow and become popular among Java web developers.

As a successor to the original Struts 1.x, check out Struts 2.x or more recent versions
as well as the Struts-provided
https://struts.apache.org/plugins/spring/[Spring Plugin] for built-in Spring integration.




[[tapestry]]
== Apache Tapestry

https://tapestry.apache.org/[Tapestry] is a "Component oriented framework for creating
dynamic, robust, highly scalable web applications in Java."

While Spring has its own xref:web/webmvc.adoc#mvc[powerful web layer], there are a number of unique
advantages to building an enterprise Java application by using a combination of Tapestry
for the web user interface and the Spring container for the lower layers.

For more information, see Tapestry's dedicated
https://tapestry.apache.org/integrating-with-spring-framework.html[integration module for Spring].
