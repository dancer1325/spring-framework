* AssertJ integration
    ** built | `MockMvc` / differences
        *** NO need to use static imports
            **** Reason: ğŸ§ requests and assertions can be crafted -- via -- fluent API ğŸ§ 
        *** Unresolved exceptions -- are handled -- consistently
            **** -> NOT need to throw (or catch) `Exception`
        *** NO need for special handling -- for -- Async requests

* `MockMvcTester`
    ** == entry point for the AssertJ support
    ** allows
        *** crafting the request
        *** returning a result / -- is -- AssertJ compatible
            **** -> can be wrapped | standard `assertThat()` method
