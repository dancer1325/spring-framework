= Parallel Test Execution

* 👁️Spring TestContext Framework -- provides basic support for -- executing tests in parallel | 1! JVM 👁️
  ** == MOST test classes OR test methods -- can be run in -- parallel / NO changes required
  ** ⚠️requirements ⚠️
    *** underlying `TestContext` implementation -- provides a copy -- constructor
      **** {spring-framework-api}/test/context/TestContext.html[`TestContext`]
      **** _Example:_ `DefaultTestContext`
      **** if you use a TP `TestContext` implementation -> you need to check it
* if you want to set up parallel test execution -> check the documentation for your
testing framework OR build tool
* unexpected side effects of introduce concurrency | your test suite
  ** strange runtime behavior,
  ** tests / fail intermittently
* ⭐general guidelines by Spring team / NOT recommended to run parallelism ⭐
  ** Spring Framework's
    *** `@DirtiesContext`
    *** `@MockitoBean` or `@MockitoSpyBean`
  ** Spring Boot's
    *** `@MockBean` or `@SpyBean`
  ** JUnit 4's
    *** `@FixMethodOrder` or ANY testing framework feature about ordering & NON ALL classes | parallel
      **** == if ALL classes run in parallel -> order does NOT care
  ** changeable state of shared services OR systems (embedded and external systems)
    *** _Example:_ database, message broker, filesystem, ...
* typical errors
  ** "`ApplicationContext` for the current test is no longer active"
    *** Reason: 🧠 `ApplicationContext` -- was removed from the -- `ContextCache` | different thread 🧠
    *** Possible solutions:
      **** avoid using `@DirtiesContext`
      **** exclude such tests from parallel execution
  ** "maximum size of the `ContextCache` has been exceeded"
    *** Possible solutions: increase it
    *** Check xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.adoc[context caching]
