    *** _ExampleOfThingsToTest:_
      **** _Example1:_ correct wiring of your Spring IoC container contexts
      **** _Example2:_ Data access / using JDBC or an ORM tool

[[integration-testing-goals]]
== Goals of Spring's Integration Testing support

* manage xref:testing/integration.adoc#testing-ctx-management[Spring IoC container caching] between tests.
* provide
  ** xref:testing/integration.adoc#testing-fixture-di[Dependency Injection of test fixture instances].
  ** xref:testing/integration.adoc#testing-tx[transaction management] / -- appropriate to -- integration testing.
* supply xref:testing/integration.adoc#testing-support-classes[Spring-specific base classes] / assist
  developers | writing integration tests.

[[testing-ctx-management]]
=== Context Management & Caching

* Spring TestContext Framework
  ** provides consistent loading of
    *** Spring `ApplicationContext` instances
      **** 👀by default, once it's loaded -> the configured `ApplicationContext` is reused | EACH test 👀
        ***** -> setup cost is incurred ONLY 1! / test suite -> subsequent test execution is MUCH faster
      **** see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management.adoc[Context Management]
    *** `WebApplicationContext` instances
    *** caching of those contexts
      **** 👀IMPORTANT👀
        ***** Reason: 🧠 startup time can become an issue,  because the objects instantiated by the Spring container -- take -- time to instantiate 🧠
        ***** _Example:_ project / 50 to 100 Hibernate mapping files -- MIGHT take -- 20" to load the mapping files -> can lead to slower overall test / reduce developer productivity
      **** see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.adoc[Context Caching]

* Test classes -- typically -- declare
  ** array of resource locations for XML or
    *** == those / specified |
      **** `web.xml` or
      **** other configuration files -- for -- production deployments
  ** Groovy configuration metadata
    *** OFTEN | classpath
  ** array of component classes / -- is used to -- configure the application
    *** == those / specified |
      **** `web.xml` or
      **** other configuration files -- for -- production deployments

* "`test suite`"
  ** == ALL tests / run | SAME JVM

* if unlikely case that a test corrupts the application context & requires reloading (_Example:_  modifying a bean definition or the state of an application
object) -> TestContext framework -- can be configured to --
  ** reload the configuration and
  ** rebuild the application context | BEFORE executing the NEXT test

[[testing-fixture-di]]
=== Dependency Injection of Test Fixtures

* | TestContext framework loads your application context, it -- can optionally, via Dependency Injection -- configure instances of your test classes
  ** 👀setting up test fixtures -- by using -- application context's preconfigured beans👀
  ** application contexts -- can be reused ACROSS -- VARIOUS testing scenarios
    *** _Example:_ configuring Spring-managed object graphs, transactional proxies, `DataSource` instances,
    *** NO need to duplicate complex test fixture setup -- for -- individual test cases
  ** see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.adoc[DI of test fixtures + TestContext framework]

* _Example:_ let's have `HibernateTitleRepository` / implements data access logic for a `Title` domain entity -> write
integration tests about
  ** Spring configuration
    *** everything -- related to the -- configuration of the `HibernateTitleRepository` bean correct
  ** Hibernate mapping file configuration
    *** everything mapped correctly, lazy-loading settings
  ** logic of the `HibernateTitleRepository`

[[testing-tx]]
=== Transaction Management

* state of the persistence store (EVEN, it's a development database)
  ** COMMON issues related
    *** | tests / access a real database
    *** transactionality-related
      **** MANY operations (_Example:_ inserting or modifying persistent data) can NOT be performed (or verified) OUTSIDE a transaction

* TestContext framework
  ** addresses previous issues
    *** 👀by default, the framework creates & rolls back a transaction / EACH test 👀

* if you call transactionally proxied objects | your tests -> they behave -- according to their -- configured transactional semantics

* if a test method deletes selected tables' contents | running the transaction managed for the test ->
  ** 👀transaction rolls back by default 👀
  ** database returns to its state -- prior to -- execution of the test

* transactional support -- is provided, by using a `PlatformTransactionManager` bean / defined | test's application context, to a -- test

* 👀if you want a transaction to commit -> tell the TestContext framework to cause the transaction to commit -- via -- xref:testing/annotations.adoc[`@Commit` annotation]👀
  ** instead of, the default roll back
  ** use cases
    *** (unusual) you want a particular test / populate OR modify the database

* see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/tx.adoc[transaction management -- via --TestContext framework]

[[testing-support-classes]]
=== Support Classes for Integration Testing

* Spring TestContext Framework
  ** provides
    *** 👀several `abstract` support classes / simplify the writing of integration tests 👀
    *** well-defined hooks | testing framework
    *** convenient instance variables and methods / let you access
      **** `ApplicationContext` -- for --
        ***** performing explicit bean lookups or
        ***** testing the state of the context -- as a -- WHOLE
      **** `JdbcTemplate` -- for -- executing SQL statements to query the database
        ***** allows
          ****** confirm database state (before & after execution of database-related application code)
        ***** Spring ensures that such queries' scope == transaction as the application code's scope
  ** you can create your OWN custom, application-wide superclass / instance variables & methods -- specific to -- your project
  ** + ORM tool
    *** avoid xref:testing/testcontext-framework/tx.adoc#testcontext-tx-false-positives[false positives]

* see xref:testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.adoc[support classes -- for the -- TestContext framework]
